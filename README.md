# Writing `.bat` (Batch) Files — A Practical Guide

This document explains how to create and write **Windows Batch (`.bat`) files**.

---

## 1. What Is a `.bat` File?

A **batch file** is a text file that contains a sequence of commands executed by the Windows Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`).

- Extension: `.bat`
- Purpose: automation, scripting, system tasks
- Commands run line by line

---

## 2. Creating a `.bat` File

1. Open Notepad
2. Write commands
3. Save the file with `.bat` extension
4. Set **Save as type** → `All Files`
5. Encoding: `UTF-8` or `ANSI`

---

## 3. Basic Structure

```bat
@echo off
echo Hello, World!
pause
````

* `@echo off` — disables command echoing
* `echo` — prints text
* `pause` — waits for a key press

---

## 4. Common Commands

| Command | Description      |
| ------- | ---------------- |
| echo    | Print text       |
| pause   | Pause execution  |
| cls     | Clear screen     |
| rem     | Comment          |
| exit    | Exit script      |
| cd      | Change directory |
| dir     | List files       |
| copy    | Copy files       |
| del     | Delete files     |

---

## 5. Comments

```bat
rem This is a comment
:: Alternative comment (use with caution)
```

---

## 6. Variables

```bat
set NAME=John
echo Hello %NAME%
```

⚠ No spaces around `=`

---

## 7. User Input

```bat
set /p username=Enter your name:
echo Welcome, %username%!
```

---

## 8. Conditional Statements

```bat
if exist test.txt (
    echo File exists
) else (
    echo File not found
)
```

### String Comparison

```bat
if "%answer%"=="yes" echo Confirmed
```

---

## 9. Loops

```bat
for %%i in (1 2 3) do (
    echo Number %%i
)
```

* Use `%%` in `.bat` files
* Use `%` in interactive CMD

---

## 10. Calling Other Batch Files

```bat
call another_script.bat
```

---

## 11. Functions (Labels)

```bat
call :myFunction
exit /b

:myFunction
echo Inside function
exit /b
```

---

## 12. Error Handling

```bat
somecommand
if errorlevel 1 (
    echo An error occurred
)
```

---

## 13. Running a `.bat` File

```cmd
script.bat
```

Or double-click the file.

---

## 14. Best Practices

* Use `@echo off`
* Quote variables: `"%var%"`
* Comment your code
* Test scripts safely
* Be careful with destructive commands

---

## 15. Example Script

```bat
@echo off
set /p name=What is your name?
echo Hello, %name%!
pause
```

---

## 16. Notes

* `.bat` files run with user permissions
* Use `setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion` for advanced logic
* `.cmd` is recommended for modern scripts
